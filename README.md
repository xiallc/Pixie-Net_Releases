# Pixie-Net Software

This release contains all software necessary to work with the Pixie-Net device. You 
will need to compile the executables using the `make` command from the project root 
directory. I.e. the same directory containing this README. These files are installed 
into the `/var/www` directory on the Pixie-Net's OS.

Firmware may be downloaded from the 
[Pixie-Net Release page](https://github.com/xiallc/Pixie-Net_Releases/releases). 
**Ensure you download the firmware associated with your software release.** 
`PixieNetDefs.h` contains the software version information in the `PS_CODE_VERSION` 
variable. To convert the hex number to a version, take the first two digits as the 
major version the second two correspond to the minor. For example, 0x0224 would be 
software version 2.24.

## Firmware Type Descriptions

### Standard (STD)

This is the standard release firmware. It contains the basic funcationality necessary 
for data collection and analysis.

### Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA)

Includes pulse shape analysis functions to distinguish gammas and neutrons. It 
also includes constant fraction timing logic. Licensing required to use this firmware.

### I2C

Modifies PMOD I/O pins to support I2C and UART from Linux. Also includes real-time 
clock driver in Linux kernel.

### PTP

Provides hardware time stamping for LinuxPTP utility. Requires use of alternate 
Ethernet port.
